To activate the script in an area, do the following:
 1. Put an event into the map.
 2. In the 'Note' field (Next to the name) put the following text :
 Light 250 #FFFFFF
 - Light activates the script
 - 250 is the lightradius of the object
 - #FFFFFF is the lightcolor (white in this case)
 You're done, its that simple.
 

**************** Player options ******************

You can set the starting radius of the player in the settings of the plugin.
You can alter the lightradius of the player with 
Plugin command: Light radius 200 #FFFFFF   (with 200 radius, color #FFFFFF)
If you want to change the player radius slowly over time (like a dying torch)
use the command 'Light radiusgrow 200 #FFFFFF'
You can alter the brightness of the players lightsource by adding: 
Light radius 200 #FFFFFF B70' (Brightness values between 0 and 99, 0 is default)

Replacing the 'Light' keyworld with 'Fire' will give the lights a subtle flicker
You can configure the fire effect with the plugin command 'SetFire 7 10'
Where 7 is the radius change and 10 is the shift in color from red to yellow. 

To use a flashlight effect use 'Flashlight on 8 12 #FFFFFF 3' and 'Flashlight off'
The arguments are optional (8=beamlength, 12=beamwidth, #FFFFFF=color, 3=beam density)

Examples : 
Plugin command: Light radius 200 #FF0000   -> Player radius 200, color red.
Plugin command: Light radius 1 #000000 -> Player has no light at all.
Plugin command: Light radius 100 #FFFFFF B70 -> Player has a small, very bright light.
Plugin command: Fire radius 200 #FFAAAA  -> Player has a torch with a red/yellow color
Plugin command: Fire radiusgrow 1 #FFAAAA -> The players torch slowly dies until its completly gone
Plugin command: Flashlight on 8 12 #FFFFFF 3  -> Turn on a flashlight instead of a globe around the player.
Plugin command: Flashlight off -> Turn off the flashlight and resume with a lightglobe.

Player Fire Settings: 
Plugin command:  SetFire 20 15  -> If the player is using a torch this will increase the flickerrate and colorshift a lot
Plugin command:  SetFire 3 5 -> Reduced flicker-rate and colorshift.  
Plugin command:  SetFire 7 10  -> Will set flickerrate and colorshift of the torch to default.


**************** Event options ***********************

Giving events lightsources is done by adding a definition to the tag.
Lightsources will automaticly move with events that move.

In the 'Note' field (Next to the name) put the following text :
Light 250 #FFFFFF

 You can add two optional commands for brightness and direction
 Light 200 #FFFFFF B50 increases the brightness with 50%. Value between 0 and 99.
 Light 200 #FFFFFF D1 will give half a lightglobe for lightsources placed on walls.
  1. For lights on north walls, light will face down.
  2. For lights on east walls, light will face west.
  3. For lights on south walls, light will face north.
  4. For lights on west walls, light will face east.
 
 To turn on and off lightsources in the game, do the following:
 Give the lightsource the normal def :  Light 250 #FFFFFF and an extra number so it becomes 'Light 250 #FFFFFF 1'

 (If your using the optional brightness and direction place it after those (Light 250 #FFFFFF B50 D2 1)

 To turn on this light use plugin command : 'Light on 1'.
 To turn off the light use plugin command : 'Light off 1'.
 To change the color of a light use plugin command : 'Light color 1 #FF0000'.
 The plugin command will also trigger SelfSwitch 'D' on the targeted light(s).
 You can reset the switches each map with the option or manualy by  the plugin command 'Light switch reset' 
 
You can also turn off lights with the kill-selfswitch defined in the parameters. If you set the killswitch in the 
parameters to 'C', the light will turn off when selfswitch C of an event is thrown. 
 
Events can also use the flashlight effect.
Use 'Flashlight 8 12 #888888 1 2' in the note-tag.
8 is the length of the flashlights beam .
12 is the width of the beam. 
#888888 is the color of the beam.
The last numbers are optional and can be used to turn the NPC's flashlight on or off and set the direction of the beam
 if the event is not moving (1=up, 2=right, 3=down, 4=left) the default is down.


**************** Using tiletags or regions to display lights **************

TileLight and RegionLight settings
To create lightsources without using events you can use the following plugin command.
TileLight 1 ON #FFFFFF 150  Will create a lightsource (color #FFFFFF radius 150) on all tiles with tile-tag 1.
TileRegion 1 ON #FFFFFF 150 Will create a lightsource on all tiles with region-number 1.
You can increase the brightness of a lightsource with the optional TileRegion 1 ON #FFFFFF 150 B50  (for 50% increased brightness)
TileLight 1 OFF will turn off the lights on tile-tag 1 again 
TileRegion 1 OFF will turn off the lights on region-number 1 again  
TileFire and RegionFire works the same as TileLight, but with fire effect.
TileGlow and RegionGlow works the same as TileLight, but with a slight pulsing effect.
Make sure your map still has at least one event with lights in it, otherwise the script will not run.
 
 TileBlock and RegionBlock settings
 To block lights on certain tiles (roofs for instance) you can use the following plugin command.
 TileBlock 1 ON #000000  Will block light on tiles with tile-tag 1. 
 RegionBlock 1 ON #000000 Will block lights on tiles with region-number 1.
 TileBlock 1 OFF and TileRegion 1 OFF turns off the blocking again.
 To darken but not completly block light use a slightly higher color setting (#333333) for instance.
 This function does not raytrace. If the players lightradius is bigger then the blocking tiles the 
 light will show on the other side. For the best effect keep the lightradius a bit smaller then the block section.
 for advance users, if you want to block more or less of the tile you can do the following
 RegionBlock 1 ON #000000 shape xoffset yoffset width height
 RegionBlock 1 ON #000000 1 20 20 10 10   -> this will block a box starting at 20,20 with width and height 10,10
 RegionBlock 1 ON #000000 2 20 20 10 10   -> this will block a oval starting at 20,20 with xradius 10 and yradius 10


**************** Decrease overal darkness **************

If you think the night is to dark you can use the tint command to make it less dark.
The plugin command 'Tint set #333333' will make the room less dark.

The plugin command 'Tint fade #777777 5' will fade the color from the current color to the new, the last
number (5) is the speed of the fade, were 1 is a fast fade and 20 is a very slow one.
If an area has a daynight cycle system, the tint system is disabled.


**************** Day/Night cycles ********************

To activate a day-night cycle on a map, put an event with 'DayNight' in the notetag or put 'DayNight' in the map note.
Plugin command 'Daynight speed 10' changes the speed.
Speed 10 means it takes 10 seconds to to pass one hour in game (probably to fast)
 
Plugin command 'Daynight hour 16 30' sets the hour to 16:30 hours
You can add time with the plugin command 'Daynight add 8 30' (this adds 8 hours and 30 minutes) 

Each hour has its own color value.
Plugin command 'Daynight color 0 #222222' changes 0:00 hours to color value '#222222'
 
If you want to use the time of day to trigger effects (like turning on lights when it gets dark)
you can use the parameters 'Save DaynightHours','Save DaynightMinutes','Save DaynightSeconds'
The default is 0, which means its off.
If you set it to a value,5 for example, it will store the daynight value inside game variable 5.
You can then use that variable to trigger lights.
To help syncing/debugging the time system you can use scriptcommand 'daynight debug' to display the current time.
If you want to go 'alien world' and stuff, you can change the number of hours in a day with
script command 'daynight hoursinday 48' (for 48 hours in day, don't forget to fill in the hour values)
 
Terrax lighting system is compatible with the Moghunter time system, for specifics see the read-me.


**************** Effects ************************

You can use the following plugin calls to create short duration light effects for explosions or spells.

plugin command: effect_on_event 003 200 #FFAAAA 50  -> Will create a lightglobe on event with id 003, Radius 200, color #FFAAAA, duration 50 frames
plugin command: effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 25 -> Will create a lightglobe on coordinates 560,500, Radius 50, color #FFAAAA, duration 25 frames

A number of special effects can be added

effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 FADEIN 200   -> Will start dark and slowly fade in for 200 frames and will be visible for 500 frames
effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 FADEOUT 200   -> Will start light and at frame 300 slowly fade out for 200 frames
effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 FADEINOUT 200   -> Will fade in for 200 frames, and after that fade out for 200 frames

effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 GROW 200   -> Will start with 0 radius and slowly grow over 200 frames to full radius
effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 SHRINK 200   -> Will shrink the radius at the end
effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 GROWSHRINK 200   -> Will grow to full radius and then shrink.

effect_on_xy 560 500 50 #FFAAAA 500 BIO 200  -> Combines FADEIN,GROW and FADEOUT to create a slowly forming and then fading sphere.

effect_on_xy x y radius #FFAAAA duration FADEIN duration special.
Aside from fixed values variables can also be used while scripting

effect_on_xy #0001 #0002 #0003 #FFAAAA 500 will create a lightglobe on the coordinates in game variables 1 and 2,
and the radius from game variable 3.
See the swamp area in the demo for an example.

**************** Quasi ABS compatibility ***************

1) Make sure the terraxlighting plugin is below the quasi abs plugin in the list
2) If you want to add lights to the quasi arrows/missles and such add 2 lines to the definition in the database

The definition should look like below

<absSettings>
collider: box, 12, 36
through: 3
tx_missle: 40, #FFAAAA
tx_blast: 300, #FFAAAA, 50
</absSettings>
<absSequence>
user pose atk
wait 15
picture arrow true 4
move forward 250 30
wait 30
trigger
</absSequence>

Added to the normal abs stuff is

tx_missle: 40, #FFAAAA -> this will light up the missles/spells with a radius of 40 and color #FFAAAA (red/yellow)
tx_blast: 300, #FFAAAA, 50 -> when the event triggers, it will light up the area with a radius of 300, color #FFAAAA and duration 50 clicks.
tx_onhit: 40, #FF0000, 20 -> If you want an effect when a spell hits but doesn't trigger.


**************** Turning the script on and off ************

To completly turn off the script use : Script deactivate'
To turn it on again use the command: 'Script activate'

To completly turn off the script use : 'Light deactivate'
To turn it on again use the command: 'Light activate'

Both do the same thing, script is higher in rank as light.
